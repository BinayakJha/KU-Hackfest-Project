# Khoja-Community-at-your-Palms (Beta)

As high school students, we were struggling to find opportunities for extracurricular activities, when finding team members, and even during sporting events. Despite our efforts, there were no platforms that gives people with similar interests a chance to collaborate. This gave birth to "Khoja".

<br><br>
Khoja is a unique platform -soon to be available in mobile apps- that allows users to find collaborators that share common interests. From internships to basic football teams, If you lack team members or want to search for people, Khoja comes to the rescue. Khoja provides a platform to upload user requirements/ recruitments and then fellow users browsing the site can join the hosted events.
<br><br>
Khoja is an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand concept that depends completely on the community to operate, With the ambition of providing new students, eager volunteers, or even desperate people who are looking for collaborators an easy life Khoja presents itself. 
<br><br>
Instead of scouting the Internet, different social media platforms, advertisements, and tedious amounts of phone calls, Khoja allows the users to search and upload their recruitments with the click of a button. This is what makes Khoja unique.

# Challenges We Ran Into

The ECA forms were not working till the end of the project but we figured out the issue and solved it. <br><br>
We also went in the process of choosing a good UI for the project which was not an easy thing.
